        <p>
          Hi! I&apos;m Allie, engineer by training,
          food-lover by destiny, and lifelong soup afficiando. I grew up in Northeast China, where my mom&apos;s
          bone-rich broths were a part of every meal. Moving to the U.S.,
          that tradition followed me, simmering gently in the background of my
          busy life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast-forward to my second pregnancy: coffee was out, bone broth was
          in. Each morning the slow ritual of skimming, tasting, and finally
          sipping became a moment of calm‚Äînourishing my body, steadying my
          mind, and reminding me of home. When the freezer ran out, the
          store-bought pouches I tried were either over-priced, over-salted, or
          both. So I did what any product-manager-turned-food-geek would do:
          I engineered a better broth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Leaving a corporate career that spanned healthcare software at
          Epic Systems and high-growth tech start-ups, I dove into kettles,
          not code. Today I run The Brotherie with my husband, our two young taste-testers‚Äîwho swear by chicken broth
          mac-&-cheese‚Äîand Porter the dog, whose tail thumps loudest when his
          kibble gets a broth boost. We simmer local bones low & slow, skip the
          shortcuts, and deliver the kind of honest flavor my family has loved
          for generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you&apos;re looking for a morning coffee alternative, a
          chef-grade cooking base, or simply a wholesome daily ritual, we&apos;re
          honored to bring our broth to your table. From our kitchen in
          Arlington, MA to yours. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Love, Allie
